1. Run the code "Reinforced Learning Test (Lunar Lander V2) Observation States.ipynb" to train the model.
2. Once the agent acheives 200+ average score, the game is beaten. The model will be saved in "/model".
3. Run "Watch Agent.ipynb" to watch the trained model play the game. You can also set "render" to true in the step 1 to watch while the agent learns to play the game, but it will cost more time to train.
